# PiSignage Custom Raspberry Pi 5 Setup (0.5.0)

## Purpose
This document outlines the steps taken to set up a custom Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm, 64-bit) image on a Raspberry Pi 5 to run PiSignage, since the official PiSignage OS is not yet compatible with Pi 5 hardware.

- Create a lightweight, secure base OS image compatible with Pi 5.
- Manually install all necessary dependencies.
- Install PiSignage software and ensure compatibility.
- Prepare the image for future duplication and fleet deployment.

## Why This Was Necessary

- Official PiSignage OS **does not** support Raspberry Pi 5 hardware. 
- Needed to maintain connection with the PiSignage cloud dashboard (not self-hosted).
- Needed to control what goes into the image (e.g., security hardening, default Wi-Fi, monitoring tools).

## Steps Taken

### 1. Base Image Setup

Installed Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm Lite (64-bit).
Verified architecture: Pi 5 uses 64-bit ARM (aarch64).

### 2. System Tools and Security Packages

Installed:

- fail2ban
- ufw
- ssh
- network-manager
- node-exporter (manually compiled)
- Configured UFW with basic ruleset.

### 3. Networking Configuration

Fixed Wi-Fi using rfkill unblock and ensured firmware was present.

Configured /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with company Wi-Fi credentials to auto-connect.

### 4. piSignage Software Setup

Attempted:
---
git clone of https://github.com/colloqi/pi-player.git and piSignage-player-service failed — repositories are private or removed.

Worked:
---
- Downloaded pi-image-p2-v20.zip from official PiSignage release site.
- Extracted the archive and found player2/ source tree.
- Used the install script: ./player2/build-scripts/install-pisignage.sh
- Had to move the entire player2 folder to /root/ to avoid script path issues.
- Installed missing dependency figlet (optional aesthetic).

### 5. Finalizing Setup (Round 1)

Verified PiSignage service installed and running.

Ensured Chromium in kiosk mode was installed and running.

Rebooted Pi and confirmed connection to cloud (initially).

# Day Two - Major Overhaul and Troubleshooting

### 6. Refactor Toward Proper Deployment Mode

- Removed Chromium kiosk startup behavior.
- Identified that PiSignage is not a browser-based player but runs media playback via tools like mpv, cvlc, feh, etc.
- Realized localhost:8000 serves internal layouts to the portal/browser via the internal dashboard.
- Refocused on getting pisignage.js to run in root context with full system access.

### 7. Systemd Service Setup

- Created a pisignage.service systemd unit.
- Ensured it runs as root, from /root/player2, with DISPLAY=:0 set.
- Used xhost +SI:localuser:root to allow root access to X session.
- Disabled all Chromium-related startup config.
- Validated pisignage.service starts and persists across reboots.

### 8. Troubleshooting Browser Errors

- Errors about "Browser stopped with code 1" traced to start-app.sh being missing and improper X11 permissions.
- Confirmed X11 access and display resolution via xrandr after root permission fix.
- Verified VLC, MPV, Evince, and image viewers are all installed.

### 9. Portal Behavior

- Device now appears in PiSignage portal with correct name and ID.
- However, portal continues showing the device as offline.
- Unable to push content to the player from the portal.
- Verified pisignage.js is running and WebUI is active at port 8000, but curl to localhost:8000 failed previously (unknown if it’s active now).

## Setbacks and Resolutions

| Issue                                  | Solution |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Git repos asking for login             | Discovered repos are private; switched to image download |
| npm install failed                     | Repo lacked package.json, confirmed it was incorrect repo |
| Installer script hardcoded /root paths | Moved files to /root/ as workaround |
| rfkill blocked Wi-Fi                   | Unblocked + verified firmware compatibility |
| chromium-browser not starting          | Fixed xinitrc and enabled GUI auto-login (later removed) |
| ID conflict                            | Manual ID in JSON conflicted with auto-generated ID |
| Web portal didn’t detect player        | Suspect root/user mismatch; PiSignage likely tied to root setup |
| Display errors in logs                 | Due to permission/display access when not run under X
| Permissions for input/audio            | Errors when running under user instead of root
| Device ID format                       | Website expects 16-digit format with hyphens, unclear if formatting matters |
| Browser crashing                       | start-app.sh missing and improper DISPLAY/X permissions |


## Next Steps

- Begin new test using full Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm, 64-bit) instead of Lite.
- Rebuild fresh SD card image and repeat player2 install steps.
- Keep Chromium out unless necessary.
- Prioritize getting internal dashboard running and portal communication stable.
- Record this as version 0.5.0-pre under new directory.
- Track changes going forward using semantic versioning.
